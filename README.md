# Bohra Connect

"Bohra Connect" is an innovative app designed to connect and collaborate among Bohra community members worldwide. It addresses the challenge of finding like-minded individuals within the community when moving to a new country. The app aims to foster unity by transcending geographical boundaries and uses technology to empower connections. Users create profiles using their "Ejammaat ID," name, and location, which are then displayed on a global map as pins. This map allows users to explore and connect with fellow community members nearby, facilitated by social media links on each profile. "Bohra Connect" is not just an app but a movement to strengthen the bonds of the Bohra community globally through technology.
